AppDynamicsLogEventMonitor
==========================

Dynamically monitors log files and creates AppDynamics events using the SDK included in the Java Agent

Building
---------
To build, use ***mvn clean install -DskipTests=true***.  This will result in 2 jar files being placed into ${TOP}/target:
 
   * LogEventMonitor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   * LogEventMonitor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar
   
The second jar file builds an executable jar packaged with all required dependencies, see onejar-maven-plugin in the pom.xml - and can be run directly using ***java -jar [tail-file]***.

For customer delivery, you can rename LogEventMonitor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar as needed; e.g. 

   * mv LogEventMonitor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar AppDynamicsLogMonitor.jar
   * java -jar AppDynamicsLogMonitor.jar

Running
-------
There is a JUnit test driver - ${TOP}/src/test/java/..../LogGeneratorTest.java that can be executed to generate a set of log file which will be parsed.  Updates to the log files are made on a 1-second frequency.  By default, the generated log file is ${TOP}/out/learning.log.

This file can then be tailed, and events will be generated by running:

java -jar LogEventMonitor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar ${TOP}/out/learning.log
